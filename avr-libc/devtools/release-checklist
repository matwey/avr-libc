  $ cvs up -dP
  $ vim configure.ac                # set the version number.
  $ vim ChangeLog                   # update to note the release.
  $ vim <foo>                       # Edit any other files to note release.
  $ ./bootstrap                     # or whatever for that project
  $ mkdir obj-rel && cd obj-rel
  $ ../configure --prefix=$PWD/_install <other-opts>
  $ make && make install

From there, have a look at what got installed to be sure that everything
you expect is there and in the right place.

Verify that './prog --help' is in sync with new/removed options.

Check the man pages if installed.

Check that any other docs got installed and are usable.

I also checked building the rpms from the tarball.

If everything looks ok, try rolling the tarball:

  $ make distcheck

If that passes, commit the final changes to cvs. Tag the release. Do the
"bootstrap, configure, make distcheck" dance once more. Sign the release
and upload it to the server.

It sometimes takes a few iterations to be sure that all the new files
end up in the tarball and get installed.
