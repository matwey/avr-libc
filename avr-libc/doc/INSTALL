Installation instructions:

1. Build and install the current version of binutils from CVS (or release
   2.13 when available - older releases are not supported) for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr).  See http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/ .

2. Build and install the current version of GCC from CVS (or release 3.2
   when available - older releases are not supported) for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++).  C++ support is
   still experimental and incomplete (no libstdc++), and needs testing.

3. Now you can build and install avr-libc -
   type "./doconf && ./domake", then (as root, or user with write
   permissions to the installation directory) "./domake install".
   Note: it is necessary to use a separate build directory for avr-libc
   (building in the source directory does not work correctly) - the
   "doconf" and "domake" scripts do just that.

By default, everything is installed under /usr/local - you can change
that if you execute "PREFIX='what_you_want' ./doconf". There are other
configure options if you like.  Type "./configure --help" to see them.

Important: you MUST use the current CVS or snapshots of GCC and binutils
(which will be released as GCC 3.2 and binutils 2.13).  Older versions
are not supported anymore, and will fail in various strange ways.
