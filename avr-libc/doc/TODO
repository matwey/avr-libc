TODO for avr-libc:

Before 1.0:
    - Move the following to include/compat and document
        * include/avr/ina90.h
        * include/avr/timer.h
        * include/avr/twi.h
    - Verify that include/avr/*.h do not reference anything in include/avr/ina90.h
    - Move the following to examples and document
        * include/avr/parity.h
    - In include/avr/delay.h, add macros to allow specifying delays directly 
      in microseconds (with MCU clock frequency defined by the user).  With 
      constant delays, all floating point math would be done at compile time. 
    - Document:
        * include/avr/crc16.h
        * include/avr/parity.h
        * include/avr/delay.h (also see above)
        * merge chapter 3 from Rich Neswold's doc. Needs some rewriting to
          update for newer tools. (explanation of start code)
        * gcrt1.S
        * how to pre-program the EEPROM.
        * how to roll your own crt*.o ???
        * the mechanism behind include/avr/io*.h [Joerg has patch [5].]
    - Move out the common register definitions into <avr/io.h>
      [Joerg has done a major part of it, but there might be more to move
      around.]

After 1.0:
    - Figure out how to remove __ prefix from function args in dox.
      [Ted has workaround [5].]
    - fix signed/unsigned gcc warnings (qsort.c, strtol.c, strtoul.c)
      [Joerg has patch [1] for this that just needs some love before it's
      committed.]
    - optimize strlcpy and strlcat
      [Eric Weddington has submitted a patch [2a] [2b] with optimized versions.
	  Needs review/testing before commit.]
    - Write for avr-libc [3] : stddef.h, sys/types.h, limits.h,
      sys/systemcfg.h?
    - testsuite [4]
