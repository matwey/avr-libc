/** \page acks Acknowledgments

    This document tries to tie together the labors of a large group of
    people. Without these individuals' efforts, we wouldn't have a terrific,
    <i><b>free</b></i> set of tools to develop AVR projects. We all owe thanks
    to:

	- The GCC Team, which produced a very capable set of development tools for
	an amazing number of platforms and processors.

	- Denis Chertykov [ denisc@overta.ru ] for making the AVR-specific changes
	to the GNU tools.

	- Denis Chertykov and Marek Michalkiewicz [ marekm@linux.org.pl ] for
	developing the standard libraries and startup code for \b AVR-GCC.

	- Theodore A. Roth [ troth@verinet.com ] for setting up avr-libc's
	CVS repository, bootstrapping the documentation project using
	doxygen, and continued maintenance of the project on
	http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avr-libc

	- Uros Platise for developing the AVR programmer tool, \b uisp.

	- Joerg Wunsch [ joerg@FreeBSD.ORG ] for adding all the AVR development
	tools to the FreeBSD [ http://www.freebsd.org ] ports tree and for
	providing the \ref demo_project "demo project".

	- Brian Dean [ bsd@bsdhome.com ] for developing \b avrprog (an alternate
	to <b>uisp</b>) and for contributing \ref using_avrprog "documentation"
	which describes how to use it.

	- All the people who have submitted suggestions, patches and bug reports.
    (See the AUTHORS files of the various tools.)

	- And lastly, all the users who use the software. If nobody used the
	software, we would probably not be very motivated to continue to develop
	it. Keep those bug reports coming. ;-)
