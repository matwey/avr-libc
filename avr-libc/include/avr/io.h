/** \defgroup avr_io AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.

    Note that each of these files always includes
    \code #include <avr/sfr_defs.h> \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for the details.

    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that Atmel is not very consistent in its naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.

    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".

    Finally, the following macros are defined:

    - \b RAMEND

    A constant describing the last on-chip RAM location.

    - \b XRAMEND

    A constant describing the last possible location in RAM.
    This is equal to RAMEND for devices that do not allow for
    external RAM.

    - \b E2END

    A constant describing the address of the last EEPROM cell.

    - \b FLASHEND

    A constant describing the last byte address in flash ROM. */
