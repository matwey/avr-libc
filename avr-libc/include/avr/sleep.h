    Use of the \c SLEEP instruction can allow your application to reduce it's
    power comsumption considerably. AVR devices can be put into different
    sleep modes by changing the \c SMn bits of the \c MCU Control Register (
    \c MCUCR ). Refer to the datasheet for the details relating to the device
    you are using. */
