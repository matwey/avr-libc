	<h3>Introduction to the Time functions</h3>
    This file declares the time handling system that is implemented in \c avr-libc.
    
    The implementation attempts to conform to ISO/IEC 9899 (C90). However, since there is no 
    platform standard method to obtain the current time, time zone, or daylight savings 
    'rules', the application needs to initialize the system time with this information. 
	The functions set_zone(), set_dst(), and set_system_time() are provided for this intialization.
	
	Once initialized, system time may be maintained by calling system_tick() at one
	second intervals.
