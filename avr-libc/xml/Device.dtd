This file provides a Document Type Definition (DTD) for XML data files which
describe everything thing we need to generate the <avr/io*.h> header files.

Although ATMEL supplies XML device files already with AvrStudio >= 4.x, they
contain far more data than we need. In addition, there is information that we
which they do not provide. Also, it may not be legal for us to include those
files with avr-libc.

I hope to write a python program which will read ATMEL's XML files and spit
out a file which will validate against this DTD so that we can leverage the
data in those file.
